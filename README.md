# Image Browser

This little script can create a browsable HTML image library from raw images.

## How to install
```
git clone git@github.com:chlewe/imageBrowser.git
cd imageBrowser
```

You need `python3` and `imagemagick` installed on your machine.

## How to use
Move your images into the same directory as the `imageBrowser.py` script,
then execute `make`. Now you can visit your library by navigating your browser
to the `index.html` page.
